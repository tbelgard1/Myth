"ReadMe" for Bungie.net MythII Metaserver Open Source
-----------------------------------------------------

This file must accompany the distribution of Bungie Studio's
"Bungie.net" MythII metaserver source code. This source code is
being distributed under the Bungie.net Open Source License;
refer to the file "License.txt" for the terms of this license
agreement.


What is this stuff?
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the source code for Bungie's MythII metaserver, the
backend server system that supported MythII online play over
the Internet for several years. The day has come for Bungie's
MythII server to be retired. This source code for the server
is being released so that the Myth community will have a
starting point for creating their own Myth server system,
should the need or desire to do so arise.

The Bungie.net metaserver code was developed for the Linux
operating system. It is written entirely in the "C" programming
language. As distributed it should readily compile for most recent
Linux distributions. It could be ported to most other Posix
compliant operating systems with a Berkely sockets implementation
with a little effort (such as Open/Free/NetBSD, MacOSX or Windows).


So I can run my own Bungie.net MythII server now?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can. In fact, there is already a worthy successor to the
Bungie.net Myth/MythII servers in operation, run by the "Marius.net" 
team, which was developed entirely from scratch. You can learn more 
about "Marius.net" at "http://www.mariusnet.com/".

It is not our intention to promote competing Myth game servers. 
Rather, the hope is that by making the original source code for the 
"Bungie.net" servers available, the Myth community will have the 
ability to sustain itself without any additional "official" support 
from, or reliance upon, Bungie Studios. The "Marius.net" system is 
a fine solution for the casual Myth/MythII player to use in order 
to get their online Myth gaming fix, and we hope that additional 
servers will appear if the need arises.


Hey I have a problem! Where do I go for support?
------------------------------------------------------

While Bungie Studios is not providing any official support for this
source code, we are providing a space on the "Bungie.net" website
for use by the development community to coordinate and communicate
with each other. You can check out this website at:
