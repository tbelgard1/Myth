Build changes for stock bungie.net metaserver, Aug 16, 2003 
by Alan Wagner.. questions, comments, alanw@cox.net

***********************************************************



Target platforms: linux (gcc) and Windowz (cygwin).

Goal: This 'spaghetti Code' should readily compile using gcc or g++, warning free
for either BN2_FULLVERSION or BN2_DEMOVERSION

Note: Most changes are commented with "ALAN", and all original code I modified was
commented out and left in place.



Pre-build steps:

build_settings.txt modified - added a target platform (linux)

"cseries.h" modified -  see file for details

"cseries.c" - cygwin specific modifications



**At this point we have a good build, although hundreds of compiler warnings :(



Code 'fixes':

Note: these modified files have had numerous changes including, but not limited to:
 * implicit declaration errors - fixed
 * simple format/args warnings - fixed
 * unused/unitialized variables - fixed
 * multi-character character constant warnings - fixed
 * syntax errors - fixed
 * incompatible pointer type errors - fixed
 * improper parameter list errors - fixed

***********************************************************


Additional files modified:

Note: these files have additional modifications solely for "usability" as BN2_FULLVERSION server:

"rank.c" - runtime bugfix
"main.c" - password defeat
"authentication.c" - minimal room authentication code




**********************************************

        Setup & Running the server

**********************************************



"build_settings.txt":

set CFLAGS appropriate to the target platform. For targeting windows platform
with Cygwin, use -D linux AND -D CYGWIN. Set -D BN2_DEMOVERSION or -D BN2_FULLVERSION.

NOTE: password encryption has been removed by bungie and is not open-sourced, so I recommend using BN2_DEMOVERSION
to start with, as this requires no database maintenance, no user authentication, and no passwords.




"main.c":

set LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK to the IP of the host machine in hex form.

Note: last 4 bytes of the IP should always be 0. 

Example: for IP 216.231.43.55, LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK = 0xD8E72B00




"environment.h":

set USERD_HOST to the proper host IP

For BN2_FULLVERSION set database paths



Running the server:

Start userdaemon, then start roomdaemon(s). Game Search server is optional.

This is usually set up to start and stop via shell scripts.




Enjoy
